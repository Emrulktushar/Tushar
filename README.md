            Rail transport as one of the most important means of transport, has played an important role in the transport industry in Bangladesh. With Bangladeshi economic development, the railway lines and passengers have been increasing year by year in the country. With such a huge customer base, buying train tickets problem has been very prominent. The electronic commerce could solve the problem of railway ticketing. Introduced a new online ticketing system is not only technological innovation, but also will improve the railway services, to a certain extent, solve the difficult problem of railway ticketing.
             Here, I design and achieve a railway online ticketing system. The system is structured into the data access layer, business logic layer and business exterior layer. I implement customer registration, customer cancellation, ticket inquiries, online booking, online ticket refund in the system. Business process design and database design is the focus of this system which are clearly and effectively designed. Real-time tickets messages will be feed backed to customers by the online railway booking system. The efficiency of booking is improved, manual booking errors is reduced, the management of railway passenger transport and customer booking is facilitated
